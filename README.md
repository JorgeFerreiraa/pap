# 🛹 E-commerce Website for Skate Products

As part of my **Professional Aptitude Project (12th grade – IT Management and Programming)**, I developed a **fully functional e-commerce platform** focused on selling skateboarding products.  

### 🛠️ Technologies & Features
- **PHP** – Backend logic and dynamic content management  
- **HTML & CSS** – Website structure and styling  
- **Responsive Design** – Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices  
- **Shopping Cart & Product Management** – Add, edit, and remove products easily  
- **Product Variations** – Support for **different sizes** and **multiple categories/subcategories**, making browsing and selection easier for users

This project was my **first major experience building a complete digital product**, covering all stages from **planning and design** to **implementation and testing**.  

It helped me to:  
- Strengthen my **technical skills** in web development  
- Apply **problem-solving strategies** to real-world challenges  
- Gain practical experience in **developing, deploying, and managing a full-fledged web application**
