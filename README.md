# ðŸ›¹ E-commerce Website for Skate Products

As part of my Professional Aptitude Project (12th grade â€“ IT Management and Programming), I developed an e-commerce platform focused on selling skateboarding products.

The project was built with:

- PHP for backend logic and dynamic content

- HTML & CSS for structure and styling

- A responsive layout, ensuring usability across devices

- A shopping cart system and product management features



This project was my first major experience working on a complete digital product, from planning and design to functional implementation.



It allowed me to strengthen my technical skills, practice problem-solving, and understand the workflow of building a real-world web application.
